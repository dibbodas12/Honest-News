                <h2>Show the difference between var, let and const</h2>
                <p>var keyword in JavaScript: The var is the oldest keyword to declare a variable in JavaScript.

                    Scope: Global scoped or function scoped. The scope of the var keyword is the global or function
                    scope. It means variables defined outside the function can be accessed globally, and variables
                    defined inside a particular function can be accessed within the function. </p>
                <p>let keyword in JavaScript: The let keyword is an improved version of the var keyword.

                    Scope: block scoped: The scope of a let variable is only block scoped. It can't be accessible
                    outside the particular block ({block}). Let's see the below example.</p>
                <p>const keyword in JavaScript: The const keyword has all the properties that are the same as the let
                    keyword, except the user cannot update it.

                    Scope: block scoped: When users declare a const variable, they need to initialize it, otherwise, it
                    returns an error. The user cannot update the const variable once it is declared. </p>

                <h2>Show the difference between regular function and arrow function </h2>
                <p>1.Arrow functions are a new way to write anonymous function expressions and
                    Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable.

                </p>
                <p>2.Inside of a regular JavaScript function, this value (aka the execution context) is dynamic.
                    The behavior of this inside of an arrow function differs considerably from the regular function's
                    this behavior. The arrow function doesn't define its own execution context.
                    No matter how or where being executed, this value inside of an arrow function always equals this
                    value from the outer function. In other words, the arrow function resolves this lexically.</p>

                <p>3.Inside the body of a regular function, arguments is a special array-like object containing the
                    list of arguments with which the function has been invoked.
                    On the other side, no arguments special keyword is defined inside an arrow function.
                    Again (same as with this value), the arguments object is resolved lexically: the arrow function
                    accesses arguments from the outer function.</p>

                <p>4.Return expression statement returns the result from a function If the return statement is missing,
                    or there's no expression after return statement, the regular function implicitely returns undefined.
                    You can return values from the arrow function the same way as from a regular function, but with one
                    useful exception.

                    If the arrow function contains one expression, and you omit the function's curly braces, then the
                    expression is implicitly returned. These are the inline arrows function.</p>

                <h2>Show the difference among map, forEach, filter, find</h2>
                <h4>forEach()</h4>
                <p>1.The forEach() method does not create a new array based on the given array.
                    2.The forEach() method returns undefined.
                    3.The forEach() method doesn't return anything hence the method chaining technique cannot be applied
                    here.
                    4.It is not executed for empty elements.
                    5.It is an ECMAScript5 (ES5) feature.
                </p>
                <h4>map()</h4>
                <p>1.The map() method creates an entirely new array.
                    2.The map() method returns the newly created array according to the provided callback function.
                    3.With the map() method, we can chain the other array Instance methods i.e returned value of the
                    map() method invokes the next method in the chain.
                    4.It does not change the original array.
                    5.It calls a function once for each element in an array.
                </p>
                <h4>find()</h4>
                <p>1.The find() method is used to find all the descendant elements of the selected element.
                    2.The find() method finds the element in the DOM tree by traversing through the root to the leaf.
                    3.The find() method search through all the child elements only.
                    4.It does not execute the function for empty elements.
                    5.It does not change the original array.
                </p>
                <h4>filter()</h4>
                <p>1.The filter() method is used to filter all the elements.
                    2.The filter() method returns the element that matches and removes the element that does not match.
                    3.The filter() method search through all the elements
                    4.It does not execute the function for empty elements.
                    5.The filter() method does not execute the function for empty elements.
